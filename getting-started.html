				<h3>Getting Started - Quick start</h3>
				<p>Involt works like bridge between hardware and software. It's HTML/CSS framework bundled with hardware interactions - just define parameters of what to send where with CSS classes. The hardware part is reduced to minimum where framework handles only the communication and triggering functions. Involt from technical point of view does two things. It transfers variables between Arduino and app so they are accessible from both sides. Secondly, it contains UI kit generated by CSS classes and manipulated by JQuery. </p>
				<p>The purpose of Involt is fast and easy prototyping - for more details about the project read the <a href="about.html">about</a> page</p>
				<h4>What communication methods are supported?</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Serial - desktop</li>
					<li>Bluetooth (2.0/classic) - desktop and mobile</li>
					<li>Bluetooth LE (early beta) - mobile</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Even if it's HTML based, currently Involt has no IoT online support. However, for prototyping purpose it's rarely required to have this kind of communication or online service inluded at early stage.</p>
				<h4>How to install</h4>
				<p>Involt on desktop is created on top of Chrome API as offline <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/apps/about_apps">Chrome Packaged App</a>. It's easy to setup and suitable for Involt where Chrome dependency is not that important at all. The project works on Windows, OS X and Chrome OS (On Linux serial should work). For mobile installation go to <a href="getting-started/mobile.html">Mobile page.</a></p>
				<p>This guide uses serial connection by default.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Install Google Chrome.</li>
					<li><a href="https://github.com/Involt/Involt">Download</a> and unpack Involt.</li>
					<li>In Chrome go to tools > extensions.</li>
					<li>Toggle Developer mode</li>
					<li>Click "Load unpacked extension..." and choose www folder.</li>
				</ol>
				<img src="img/install.jpg" alt="chrome settings install">
				<p>Now open your project with launch button or Chrome App Launcher. If everything is ok you should see the window on the right. On the screen you should see available serial port lists and your device plugged in.</p>

				<h4>Adding UI element</h4>
				<p>To create Involt HTML element, describe its type and parameters as CSS classes. By doing this, the device is controlled without actually programming from app side. These parameters are consistent for each object so understanding how basic button works will similarly adapt to other UI elements. Below are two most basic examples. Read more: <a href="getting-started/htmlsyntax.html">HTML UI & CSS syntax</a>.</p>
				<div class="code syntax"><p>ard [element] [pin] [value] [parameters] </p></div>
				<h4>Read data from Arduino</h4>
				<p>Reading data from Arduino is easy. Everything you need is the <span>involtSend(pinIndex, value)</span> function inside included (involt-basic) sketch and HTML UI element you wish to communicate in index.html. Value of pin is stored and updated automatically from both sides.</p>
				<p>Involt requires to write code from both sides, usually it's one line in app and one in sketch. The advantage of this solution is the fact that it's easier to adapt existing device and you can easily operate with basics of programming in Arduino IDE without any advanced topics.</p>
				<p>It's highly recommended that you do most of the value calculations within your device. Otherwise you need to use <a href="getting-started/functions.html">in-app functions</a> which is harder.</p>
				<p>Add this to arduino sketch:</p>
				<div class="code arduino">
					<div class="code-m">
						...
						<br><br>
						void loop(){
						<p>involtReceive(); </p>
						<br>
						<p style="color:blue;">involtSend(0, analogRead(A0));</p>
						<p>delay(2);</p>
						}
						<br><br>
						...
					</div>			
				</div>
				<p>Now add this element to index.html file. After connecting something to A0 (knob or anything else) you should see the value changing.</p>
				<div class="code html">
					&lt;div class="ard show A0"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
				</div>
				<img src="img/show.jpg" alt="show value from knob">
				<h4>Send data to Arduino</h4>
				<p>Sending data requires <span>digitalWrite</span> or <span>analogWrite</span> with <span>involtPin[pinIndex]</span> array value. The values in this array are updated automatically. Sending and receiving can be related to any variable you want - not only pin states. You can use this array to store values for sketch functions.</p>
				<div class="code arduino">
					<div class="code-m">
						...
						<br><br>
						void loop(){
						<p>involtReceive(); </p>
						<br>
						<p style="color:blue;">analogWrite(5, involtPin[5]);</p>
						}
						<br><br>
						...
					</div>			
				</div>
				<p>The button will send pwm value 123 to pin 5 and turn on connected LED.</p>
				<div class="code html">
					&lt;div class="ard button P5 value-123"&gt;Click me&lt;/div&gt;
				</div>
				<img src="img/button.jpg" alt="show value from knob">
				<h4>Summary</h4>
				<p>As you see, using Involt is easy to understand. There is more you can do with Involt and it's widely explained in next chapters. Playing with <a href="examples.html">examples</a> is good idea to practice.</p>
				<p>Sounds trivial? Maybe. Creating layouts with CSS sounds like something banal but have you ever thought about adding hardware interactions with it directly, without any online controled services or figuring out how to establish connection? With Involt, combining interactions is easy as never before and opens new ways in prototyping and further development. Calling this way of designing "tangible css" is something well describing what actually happens when you use Involt.</p>
				<p>Depending on your workflow, whether its focused on layout, front end, or device itself, developing and iterating both sides of project at once is crucial and can't be separated. It's good to know how Involt works and what values must be transfered before starting the project (not everything must be send to app/device). It's easy to start from both ways - from app to device and vice versa. Thanks to CSS, another great thing in Involt is the ease with which you can hook up the hardware when you discovered Involt halfway through the project. </p>
