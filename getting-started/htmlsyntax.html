				<h3>HTML UI & CSS syntax</h3> 
				<p>This page is about everything related to the app and its HTML side and settings. Involt converts CSS classes into specified user interface element, function and its parameters. The <span>ard</span> class defines the Involt object.</p>
				<p>Everything must be included in <span>index.html</span> and created as single page layout (still you can add the pagination system similar to JQuery mobile or use <a href="layout.html">Involt layout</a>).</p>
				<h4>Element structure</h4>
				<p>The most basic explanation of syntax looks like this:</p>
				<div class="code syntax"><p>ard [element] [pin] [value] [parameters]</p></div>
				<p>As a class within HTML element, it looks like this:</p>
				<div class="code html">&lt;div class="ard [element] [pin] [value] [parameters]"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</div>
				<p>Example of rangeslider:</p>
				<div class="code html">&lt;div class="ard rangeslider P9 value-0 range-0-255 step-5"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</div>
				<p>The list of elements and what parameters they need check <a href="../reference.html">reference page.</a></p>
				<h4>Involt pins</h4>
				<p>Pins are not only the direct representation of device pins (<span>A0</span> analog pin as <span>A0</span> pin in app). Keeping the Pin-to-Pin relation is most intuitive and highly recommended to maintain readability of your code. However, you can send more values than your device pin numbers so you can have control over some specific calculations. Moreover, if you don't wish to use the value for digital/analog write, for example - send string and show it on LCD display, you can also send that as Involt pin even if it's not used for any pin directly. It's possible to send values to things connected via expander with unused pins - for example Uno have 13 pins, so extend the pin index over 13 to distribute the data (as fake pins). Treat them as a container of values that by sending or receiving are accessible from both sides. Below there are explanations of pin types:</p>
				<p>P - Send numeric value (only)</p>
				<p>S - Send string, <span>S0</span> is not the same as <span>P0</span> and is send to different array in Arduino sketch.</p>
				<p>A - Read only (string and numeric)</p>
				<h4>Value</h4>
				<p>It defines the value that element is going to send on specific action. It defines the beginning value of dynamic elements: like knob and rangeslider (default is 0). It can be numeric value or string (with S pin).</p>
				<div class="code html">value-[value]</div>
				<p>Some elements requires two values:</p>
				<div class="code html">value-[value1]-[value2]</div>
				<p>Shorthand for single numeric value, it must be right after the pin:</p>
				<div class="code html">[pin] [number]</div>
				<p>When string is longer than one word use string HTML attribute:</p>
				<div class="code html">&lt;div class="ard button S0" string="send something"&gt;Click me&lt;/div&gt;</div>
				<h4>Parameters</h4>
				<p>The parameters determine how elements behave, you don't have to add them in specific order nor add them at all, if you use their default values. </p>
				<p>Range - used to define minimum and maximum range of element. For read only default range is 0-1024 and for sending it's 0-255.</p>
				<div class="code html">range-[minimum]-[maximum]</div>
				<p>Step - the increment or decrement step of dynamic elements. Default is 1.</p>
				<div class="code html">step-[value]</div>
				<p>Function - send additional function name to device when element event occurs so the device can react to certain events in app. The function can be triggered immediately in Arduino sketch. Check the <a href="functions.html">functions page</a>.</p>
				<div class="code html">fn-[name]</div>
				<h3>Editing the CSS</h3>
				<p>For customizing the visual aspects of your app, the most important file is <span>framework.css</span> - it contains styling of Involt elements. The <span>layout-components.css</span> have styling of loader and Involt pagination system. These stylesheets are not required if you don't use them so feel free to customize you layout. Keep in mind that some elements generates additional objects and you have to include thieir styling in your new stylesheet to make them work (things like positioning the handle in rangeslider).</p>
				<h4>Prototyping UI kit for wireframing</h4>
				<p>For the purpose of fast prototyping that Involt is all about you can uncomment the <span>proto.css</span> to make simplified "overlay" of each element to make it look like a wireframe. By working as UX designer you probably know how important it is.</p>
				<h3>App settings</h3>
				<h4>How to change the project name and description?</h4>
				<p>On desktop, open <span>manifest.json</span>. Do not change other elements inside manifest because your project will disappear from launcher. For details about manifest file go to <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/manifest">Chrome Manifest website</a>. Some changes requires app to reload from chrome extensions menu.</p>
				<p>On mobile, edit the <span>config.xml</span></p>
				<h4>How to remove the loader?</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Open settings.js</li>
					<li>Change the loaderOnLaunch to false</li>
					<li>Set default connection settings below. After that Involt will connect to selected device on launch.</li>
					<li>Enjoy not selecting the device each time when app is launched</li>
				</ol>
				<h4>How to change the desktop window dimensions?</h4>
				<p>Open <span>core/background.js</span> and change <span>screenWidth</span> or <span>screenHeight</span>. To run app on fullscreen uncomment the fullscreen parameter.</p>
				<h4>Read-only elements update rate.</h4>
				<p>The update rate affects smoothness of updating HTML read elements. Default value is compromise between smoothness and cpu usage. Lower value will update objects almost in real time but will affect CPU usage (important especially on mobile). To change this open settings.js and change <span>updateRate</span>. This will not affect the connection bitrate.</p>
				<h4>Persistent connection</h4>
				<p>Due to many issues when working on code from both sides, Involt now has improved connection management. Previous versions blocked connected serial port and made tests frustrating. Now when connecting, user can decide to connect to port and closing previous connections or resume connection without rebooting device.</p>
				<p>Chrome keeps the connection for very, very short time by default. This can be extended by changing <span>isPersistent</span> to <span>true</span> in settings.js. Keep in mind that with this mode it's impossible to upload sketch to device.</p>
				<p>Issue affects only a serial connection, the bluetooth connection is not blocking the port when paired. Remember about disconnecting RX/TX pins during sketch upload.</p>
				<h4>Debug mode</h4>
				<p>Debug mode prints to console additional informations about what is happening in Involt and connection settings. To turn on debug mode open <span>settings.js</span> and change <span>debugMode</span> to <span>true</span>.</p>
