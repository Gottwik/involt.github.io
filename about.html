				<h3>About</h3>
				<h4>Why Involt?</h4>
				<p>Prototyping interactive product is multidisciplinary task. It's related to industrial design, programming, user experience and sometimes graphic design skills. Arduino is easy hardware prototyping platform but things get complicated when software is involved in project. For designers it's a huge obstacle that blocks many concepts from making it to the real world. Involt is a framework to help designers in their projects on early stages without advanced programming. The key to Involt is to "make it simple" to develop software to hardware communication.</p>
				<p>The main feature of this framework is easy and quick workflow. The syntax was inspired by popular responsive design frameworks. You can create your app with basic knowledge about HTML, CSS and Arduino. You can also create more advanced interactions with use of JavaScript and JQuery.</p>
				<h4>Who is it for?</h4>
				<p>It's a tool "for designers by designers". Nowdays there is huge focus on prototyping, iterating and user experience related stuff. More designers are involved in development process. Sometimes it's hard to start without programmer, but thanks to Involt it's easier on early stages of ideation and early prototypes. With Involt it's easy to create prototype and quickly start testing on users.</p>
				<p>It's also good starting point for entry level Arduino users.</p>
				<h4>Why it's better than other solutions?</h4>
				<p>Quick research on the web shows that there are many but not simple solutions. You can write native app for target system or look for hybrid solutions like Node.js or Evothings. Each of them requires programming skills and are not "out of the box" solutions. To work with Arduino and web app it's possible to work over wifi/ethernet but this also requires some skills and additional hardware.</p>
				<p>With CSS and Involt, creating user interface is easy and flexible. The target for framework is prototyping. For advanced interactions there are ready to use JQuery methods which are easy to understand. </p>
				<h4>Limitations</h4>
				<p>Currently Involt is build on top of Chrome Apps so it's actually not a online web app. In Chrome apps there are some limitations but it's not a problem when prototyping - most of them are possible to avoid. The communication is via serial and classic Bluetooth. In future there will be support for mobile(BT LE) and online.</p>
